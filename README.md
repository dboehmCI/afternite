Assignment #3<br>
Danny Boehm:<br>
Completed Part (1) and Part (2) of Assignment 3 as seperate scenes.
For Part (3) I updated the ThirdPerson Scene. Updates Included:
- Implemented collision control for character interactions with objects.
  -  Character cannot go up certain steep hills due to collision at a certain point. Player is able to jump onto a steep incline and walk up for a little bit before crouching and then being blocked from going higher.
- Implemented downhill movement on steep terrain. Player will now slide down a steep incline if motion is not applied to the characters movement. 
- Added camera collision detection around objects. 
- Created a Respawn Trigger Script
  - Triggers include checkpoint and Finish Goal object where the player will respawn if jumped onto the checkpoint. Also if the player jumps onto the finish line goal object, character will celebrate for completing the course.




Assignment #2<br>
Danny Boehm (5) Edits to Shooter Project<br><br>
(1) Fixed ZombieBear Pathing: ZombieBear Enemy Spawned without movement. <br>
Fixed pathing which allowed ZombieBear to spawn and move towards the player.<br>
(2)Fixed Hellephant Pathing : Enemy Elephant was not locating the player correctly and EnemyMovement was corrected. <br>
Elephant now tracks player down and attempts to trigger Player Death.<br>
(3) Corrected Gun Barrel End Width: Minimized the width of GunBarell Light to .1 instead of .5<br>
(4) Updated Enemy Spawn Points : Adjust the Spawning locations of ZomBunny, Zombear and Hellephant to match their map locations.<br>
(5) Adjusted GameOverOverlay Color: Changed the overlay color for the GameOver screen to #F45A5A00<br>
