Hello, This is Danny. I am making an edit to the README ^_^

Nicole has also made an edit to the README

Assignment #2<br>
Danny Boehm (5) Edits to Shooter Project<br><br>
(1) Fixed ZombieBear Pathing: ZombieBear Enemy Spawned without movement. <br>
Fixed pathing which allowed ZombieBear to spawn and move towards the player.<br>
(2)Fixed Hellephant Pathing : Enemy Elephant was not locating the player correctly and EnemyMovement was corrected. <br>
Elephant now tracks player down and attempts to trigger Player Death.<br>
(3) Corrected Gun Barrel End Width: Minimized the width of GunBarell Light to .1 instead of .5<br>
(4) Updated Enemy Spawn Points : Adjust the Spawning locations of ZomBunny, Zombear and Hellephant to match their map locations.<br>
(5) Adjusted GameOverOverlay Color: Changed the overlay color for the GameOver screen to #F45A5A00<br>
